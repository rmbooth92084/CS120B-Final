# CS120B-Final

# Description
This was the final project for my CS120B class and I plan to improve it past what was required for the grade. It is a game that I programmed onto a microcontroller that is displayed onto an LCD and that you controll with a couple of buttons. There is a single and two play version of the game. The player one version has to dodge obsticals and survive as long as possible while it speeds up 3 different times. The player is able to shoot some of the objects but have to just dodge the other ones. In the 2 player one, it is the exact same as the single player one except that the other player is on the other side of the screen shooting player one adding to the difficulty for player 1.
